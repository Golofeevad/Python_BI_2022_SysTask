*_Modules `sys`, `os` task_*

This task is made by contributors: Elizaveta Gafarova, Dasha Golofeeva, Anastasia Lianguzova.

## There are following utilities in the repository:

- `ls` - lists computer files and directories;

- `sort`- prints the lines of its input in sorted order;

- `wc` - prints newline, word and byte counts for the files;

- `rm` - removes the input file;

- `cat` - reads files sequentially, printing them in output;

- `cp` - copies files and directories;

- `grep` - searching text data sets for lines matching an input regular expression;

- `mkdir` - creates a new directory;

- `mv` - moves existing file/directory to a new location;

- `tail` - prints the last few number of lines of a given file (10 lines by default);

- `uniq` - filters an input file removing duplicated lines from it;

The individual scripts could be downloaded from the repo, after that`chmod +x {file}` should be runned in terminal to make files executable. The repo also contains `install.py` script. Running it enables to run the scripts without providing their paths. 

Thus, to use above-mentioned utilities one should enter `{path_to}/utility_name.py` in a command line or, after using `install.py` script just `utility_name.py`. 

### UNIX utilities usage

- `./install.py` - will not give any output in terminal but all files in a working directory will be copied to a PATH environment.  

- `ls` can be used just as ls.py or with -a option. 

`ls.py` shows files located in a given directory (a working directory by default).

-a option enables to find hidden files (their name starts with a dot)
